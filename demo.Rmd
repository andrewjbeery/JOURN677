# Defining Variables in R

= or <-

```{r}
a = 1
a
b = 2
b
c = a+b
c
```

for lists:

```{r}
list = c(1,2,3,4)
list
list[3]
```

mean
```{r}
mean(list)
```

summary

```{r}
summary(list)
```

boolean
```{r}
#this is a comment
3!=2
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
